# 📧📱 Order Notification System Setup Guide

## 🎯 What This Does

When a customer places an order, the system will automatically:

1. ✅ **Store the order in user's purchase history** (fixed the empty purchase history issue)
2. 📧 **Send detailed email notification to you (admin)** with all order details
3. 📱 **Send WhatsApp notification to your business number** with order summary
4. 🔗 **Provide direct links** to view the order in admin panel and contact customer

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 0. Install Required Dependencies (One-time Setup)

```bash
cd backend
npm install nodemailer axios --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 1. Email Notifications Setup (Gmail)

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account Settings → Security → 2-Step Verification
   - Search for "App passwords" and generate one for "Solar Express"
3. **Add to your `.env` file**:
   ```env
   EMAIL_USER=your-business-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-generated-app-password
   ADMIN_EMAIL=orders@solarexpress.pk
   ADMIN_CC_EMAIL=admin@solarexpress.pk
   ```

### 2. WhatsApp Notifications Setup (Choose One)

#### Option A: Twilio WhatsApp API (Recommended - Most Reliable)

1. **Sign up at** [Twilio](https://twilio.com)
2. **Get your credentials** from Console Dashboard
3. **Enable WhatsApp** in your Twilio account
4. **Add to `.env`**:
   ```env
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-account-sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token
   TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=+14155238886
   ADMIN_WHATSAPP=923259327819
   ```

#### Option B: CallMeBot API (Free Alternative)

1. **Add CallMeBot to WhatsApp**: Send "I allow callmebot to send me messages" to `+34 644 84 71 89`
2. **Get API key** from their response
3. **Add to `.env`**:
   ```env
   CALLMEBOT_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ADMIN_WHATSAPP=923259327819
   ```

### 3. Test the System

1. **Check configuration**:

   ```bash
   GET /api/test/config
   ```

2. **Test email only**:

   ```bash
   POST /api/test/email
   ```

3. **Test full notification system**:
   ```bash
   POST /api/test/order-notification
   ```

## 📧 Email Notification Features

The email includes:

- 🎯 **Order summary** with order number and total
- 👤 **Complete customer details** (name, phone, WhatsApp, email, address)
- 🛍️ **Detailed item list** with quantities, prices, variants
- 📝 **Special notes** from customer
- 🔗 **Direct links** to admin panel and customer WhatsApp
- ⚡ **Action checklist** for processing the order

## 📱 WhatsApp Notification Features

The WhatsApp message includes:

- 🚨 **Urgent order alert** with order number
- 👤 **Customer contact details**
- 🛍️ **Order items summary**
- 💰 **Total amount**
- 🔗 **Admin panel link**
- ⚡ **Quick action items**

## 🔧 Purchase History Fix

The system now properly:

- ✅ **Adds all order items** to user's `purchaseHistory` array
- 📅 **Records purchase date** and order reference
- 💰 **Stores price and variant** information
- 🔗 **Links to original order** via `orderReference`

## 🚨 Error Handling

- **Notifications don't fail orders**: If email/WhatsApp fails, the order still processes successfully
- **Fallback system**: Tries Twilio first, then CallMeBot for WhatsApp
- **Detailed logging**: All notification attempts are logged for debugging
- **Status tracking**: Orders track which notifications were sent successfully

## 🧪 Testing Process

1. **Configure environment** variables for at least email
2. **Test configuration** endpoint: `GET /api/test/config`
3. **Send test email**: `POST /api/test/email`
4. **Place a real test order** on your site
5. **Check your email and WhatsApp** for notifications
6. **Verify in database** that user's `purchaseHistory` is populated

## 📊 Admin Dashboard Integration

The notification emails include direct links to:

- View order details in admin panel
- Contact customer directly on WhatsApp
- Quick access to order management functions

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Environment-based configuration**: No credentials in code
- **Error masking**: Detailed errors only in logs, not API responses
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents notification spam
- **Validation**: All order data validated before sending notifications

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Set up email credentials first (easiest)
2. Test with a real order
3. Configure WhatsApp (Twilio recommended)
4. Monitor logs for any issues
5. Customize email templates if needed

The system is now ready to send you comprehensive notifications for every order with all the customer and order details you need! 🚀
